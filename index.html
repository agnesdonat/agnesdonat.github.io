    <p ID="ten">Top ten funniest quotes from the show:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>KIRK:</strong> I have night terrors.</li>
      <li><strong>LUKE:</strong> You're not a contractor, you're a craftsman!
        <br/>
<strong>T.J.:</strong> Wow. I'm a craftsman! Like Jesus!</li>
      <li><strong>LORELAI:</strong> Lane can't quit the band. She has to get famous and introduce me to Bono.
        <br/>
<strong>RORY:</strong> I told her that.
        <br/>
<strong>LORELAI:</strong> All right, let's go eat... see if we can figure out a way to salvage my future as a groupie.</li>
      <li><strong>LORELAI:</strong> What are we gonna do?
<br/>
<strong>LUKE:</strong> I've got some thoughts.
<br/>
<strong>LORELAI:</strong> Alright, but no taking me to an art museum after hours and then to an empty Hollywood bowl where you give me a pair of diamond earrings that you bought with your college money when all the time you're really in love with your best friend, the drummer, who's posing as our driver for the evening.
<br/>
<strong>LUKE:</strong> [pause] Okay, I'll think of something else.</li>
      <li><strong>EMILY:</strong> [provoking grin] I am going to Europe, Richard. I am going to Europe, and I'm going to have a marvelous time. I'm going to get up at 10:00, and I'm going to have two glasses of wine at lunch every single day.
<br/>
<strong>RICHARD:</strong> Only prostitutes have two glasses of wine at lunch.
<br/>
<strong>EMILY:</strong> Well, then buy me a boa and drive me to Reno because I am open for business.</li>
      <li><strong>JESS:</strong> Where are you getting this junk?
<br/>
<strong>LUKE:</strong> Life. I've lived.
<br/>
<strong>JESS:</strong> What, in a Bette Midler movie?
<br/>
<strong>LUKE:</strong> I'm just trying to help you out.
<br/>
<strong>JESS:</strong> Oh, please. You are the most dysfunctional person I know.</li>
      <li><strong>LORELAI:</strong> Oh, it was a meltdown. They're making it into a movie -- "Meltdown in the Park." Don't worry, it's just a working title. Baz Luhrmann's directing. And the movie Luke wears tights and sings. [...] I just hope Alec Baldwin captures your rare essence.
<br/>
<strong>LUKE:</strong> And slims down a little for the role.</li>
      <li><strong>LORELAI:</strong> Are you okay? Are you sick?
<br/>
<strong>RORY:</strong> I'm getting over a cold. You knew that.
<br/>
<strong>LORELAI:</strong> No, I didn't, because our once-wonderful relationship -- envy of all the world, more intimate than that of the naked couple in the "love is..." cartoons -- has degenerated into e-mail correspondence.</li>
      <li><strong>LORELAI:</strong> Don't kid. I'm mad and needy, and I ended up going out to dinner alone with my parents, who bickered the whole time about which Beatle is alive and which is dead.
<br/>
<strong>RORY:</strong> So, where'd they land?
<br/>
<strong>LORELAI:</strong> John and Keith are dead. Paul and Bingo are still kicking.</li>
      <li><strong>RORY:</strong> I have never seen Grandma so singularly obsessed about a piece of clothing.
        <br/>
        <strong>LORELAI:</strong> Not since I wore my <em>'Gas, Grass, or Ass - No one rides for free'</em> t-shirt to the junior league spring tea.</li>
